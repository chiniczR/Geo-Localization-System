            <remarks>
            The EcwRasterLayer represents an ECW file for drawing on the map. Simply provide
            the path and filename of the ECW file, add the layer to the MapEngine class and
            start drawing. You can also draw the layer manually outside of the MapEngine.<br/>

            	<br/>
            ECW is a wavelet image compression system developed by ER Mapper. It allows you to
            combine and compress large sets of satellite images into a single file. The images can
            be accessed very quickly at a variety of scales. It is very popular in the GIS
            community.

            <remarks>
            This protected virtual method is called from the concrete public method Open.
            The Open method plays an important role, as it is responsible for initializing the
            ImageSource. Most methods on the ImageSource will throw an exception if the state of
            the ImageSource is not opened. When the map draws each layer, it will open the
            ImageSource as one of its first steps; then, after it is finished drawing with that
            layer, it will close it. In this way, we are sure to release all resources used by the
            ImageSource.<br/>
            	<br/>
            When implementing this abstract method, consider opening files for file based-sources,
            connecting to databases in the database-based sources and so on. You will get a chance
            to close these in the Close method of the ImageSource.

            <returns>None</returns>
            <remarks>
            This protected virtual method is called from the concrete public method Close.
            The Close method plays an important role in the life cycle of the ImageSource. It may
            be called after drawing to release any memory and other resources that were allocated
            since the Open method was called.<br/>
            	<br/>
            If you override this method, it is recommended that you take the following things
            into account: This method may be called multiple times, so we suggest you write the method so
            that that a call to a closed FeatureSource is ignored and does not generate an error.
            We also suggest that in the Close you free all resources that have been opened.
            Remember that the object will not be destroyed, but will be re-opened possibly in the
            near future.
