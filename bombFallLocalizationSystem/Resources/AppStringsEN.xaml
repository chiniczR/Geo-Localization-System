    <System:String x:Key="aboutWhatString" xml:space="preserve">    This is a system meant to attempt to locate the exact location of a bomb fall (actually any
 sort of emergency event) that has been reported by a member of the public to a call-center employee.
 It is also meant to give analysts the means to properly analyse the accuracy and efficiency of the
 system and its localization algorithm.</System:String>

    <System:String x:Key="aboutInfoTitleString" xml:space="preserve">How Does It Work?</System:String>
    <System:String x:Key="aboutInfoString" xml:space="preserve">    First, there are three types of users for this system:
        
        1. Analysts
        2. Call-center employees
        3. Guests
   
    Analysts only may access the analysis (i) window. Call-center personel only can report new falls
 (ii) and update an existing fall's details (iii). Anyone (analysts, call-center employees and guests)
 can search (iv) the system's database for existing falls and access this window, the questions window
 or the share window. The activities that are call-center-employee or analyst centric require the user
 to login. In more detail, the numbered actions mentioned above can be described as:
        
        (i) Analysis - contains information ment to help them assess the accuracy and efficiency of the
        system and its localization algorithm.
        
        (ii) New Fall Report - when a call-center employee gets a call reporting a new fall, he/she
        fills up the report form on the "New Fall Report" compartment of the Main Window. As explained
        there, falls that are reported up to 10 minutes from the last report are assumed to be referring
        to the same fall. After a new report is enterd, if it refers to a previously un-reported fall, a
        new fall is added to the falls' database (their table); otherwise, it is grouped with all the
        reports that refer to this fall, and their coordinates are passed to a KMeans-Clustering algorithm,
        which is used to estimate the actual location of the fall (or falls).
        
        (iii) Update Fall Details - when a call-center employee gets a geotagged photo of a fall's
        location, he/she uploads it (the photo) in this compartment the Main Window. The photo's geotag's
        coordinates are used to update the existing fall's estimated location, and thus accurately locate 
        the fall. The difference between the actual location (found with these geotagged photos) and the 
        estimated location (previously calculated, with the KMeans algorithm) help measure the system's
        efficiency.
        
        (iv) Search - allows users to search for an existing fall, based on its location (given by either
        an address or the coordinates), the date (optional) and whether or not it has been accurately 
        located yet - i.e. if a geotagged photo of it has been uploaded yet -, as well as allow the user to
        define anacceptable deviation (by default, set to 100 Km - it is recommended to leave it over 50 Km).
