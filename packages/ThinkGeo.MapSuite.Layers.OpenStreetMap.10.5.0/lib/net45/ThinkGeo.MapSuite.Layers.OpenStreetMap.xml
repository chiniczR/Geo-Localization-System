            <summary>This method opens the Layer so that it is initialized and ready to use.</summary>
            <remarks>
            This abstract method is called from the concrete public method Open. The
            open method plays an important role, as it is responsible for initializing the Layer.
            Most methods on the Layer will throw an exception if the state of the Layer is not
            opened. When the map draws each layer, the layer will be opened as one of its first steps;
            then, after it is finished drawing with that layer, it will close it. In this way, we
            are sure to release all resources used by the Layer.<br/>
            <br/>
            When implementing the abstract method, consider opening the FeatureSource or
            RasterSource. You will get a chance to close these in the Close method of the
            Layer.

            <summary>
            This method closes the Layer and releases any resources it was
            using.
            </summary>
            <returns>None</returns>
            <remarks>
            This abstract method is called from the concrete public method Close. The close
            method plays an important role in the life cycle of the Layer. It may be called after
            drawing to release any memory and other resources that were allocated since the Open
            method was called.<br/>
            	<br/>
            If you override this method, it is recommended that you take the following things
            into account: This method may be called multiple times, so we suggest you write the method so
            that that a call to a closed Layer is ignored and does not generate an error.
            We also suggest that in the Close you free all resources that have been opened.
            Remember that the object will not be destroyed, but will be re-opened possibly in the
            near future.

            <summary>This method draws the Layer.</summary>
            <remarks>
            This method is the concrete wrapper for the abstract method DrawCore. This
                method draws the representation of the layer based on the extent you provided.<br/>
            	<br/>
            When implementing this abstract method, consider each feature and its column data
            values. You can use the full power of the GeoCanvas to do the drawing. If you need
            column data for a feature, be sure to override the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore and add
            the columns you need to the collection. In many of the styles, we add properties that
            allow the user to specify which field they need; then, in the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore,
            we read that property and add it to the collection.
